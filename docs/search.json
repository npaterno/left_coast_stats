I started my career in January 2012. I’ve been a contingent faculty member the entire time. I currently teach as an adjunct associate professor at Pierce College and as a resident instructor at Pacific Lutheran University.\r\nAside from teaching but still under the academic umbrella, I am a contributor with OpenIntro. Specifically I serve as the Data Management Lead. Fancy title that means I maintain an internal R package that serves as an intermediary between a team of volunteers, Data Hunters, and the {openintro} and {usdata} R packages. The Data Hunters compile and cultivate real world data sets for inclusion in the textbook and supplementary materials. If you’re interested in becoming a Data Hunter, please email me!\r\nRunner\r\nIn another life, I was a retail store manager at a local Fleet Feet. I spent years running 50+ miles per week and competing in races ranging from 5k’s to 100 miles (* only one of those). At one point I was even a member of (now defunct) PowerBar TeamElite. I still run but I’m not so fast anymore.\r\nTech Enthusiast\r\nI have always enjoyed technology. I like to tinker and to keep things running as long as possible and - when I can find the time and resrouces - to refurbish old computers for those in need.\r\nCurrent Setup(s)\r\nLaptop\r\nDell G3 3590\r\nCPU: Intel Core i7-9750h\r\nMemory: 32 GB Crucial Ballistix DDR4-2666\r\nStorage (boot): 500 GB Samsung 970 EVO m.2 nvme ssd\r\nStorage: 1 TB Seagate hdd\r\nWiFi: 802.11ax\r\nGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650\r\nDesktop\r\nApple Mac Mini\r\nCPU: Apple M1\r\nMemory: 16 GB\r\nStorage: 2 TB ssd\r\nWiFi: 802.11ax\r\nPeripherals\r\nKeyboard: Keychron K4 (Gateron Brown switches)\r\nKeyboard: Keychron K6 (Gateron Blue switches)\r\nMouse: Corsair Harpoon\r\nMonitors: 2 x Dell 27\"\r\nNAS\r\nSynology DS 220j\r\n2 x 4 TB Seagate Ironwolf (raid 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

More specifically, students will:\r\nGain insight into the statistical process as they execute a basic statistical study\r\nDevelop expertise interpreting and critiquing a statistical study\r\nUnderstand the basics and importance of statistical computing\r\nCourse Materials\r\nOur textbook is Introduction to Modern Statistics 1st Ed..\r\nWe will have a total of 5 computer labs using R and RStudio. There will be dedicated class time to installing the software or setting up a cloud account. Those who feel comfortable doing so can download R and RStudio prior to the start of class.\r\nThe weekly schedule and other resources can be found on our Sakai site.\r\nR Package\r\nAll materials needed for lab days can be found in the stat242 R package (package under construction as of 7/14/21). Students can install the package by running the code below in the console of RStudio (requires the `remotes`` package). As with R and RStudio, there will be dedicated time in class for this activity.\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(“remotes”)\r\n\r\n\r\nremotes::install_github(“npaterno/stat242”, build_vignettes = TRUE)\r\n\r\nEach lesson related to the statistical computing part of the course can be found as a vignette in the help file or as a slidedeck. The corresponding assignments are available as RMarkdown templates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
