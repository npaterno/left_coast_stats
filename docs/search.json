I started my career in January 2012. I’ve been a contingent faculty member the entire time. I currently teach as an adjunct associate professor at Pierce College and as a visiting instructor at Pacific Lutheran University.\r\nAside from teaching but still under the academic umbrella, I am a contributor with OpenIntro. Specifically I serve as the Data Management Lead. Fancy title that means I maintain an internal R package that serves as an intermediary between a team of volunteers, Data Hunters, and the {openintro} and {usdata} R packages. The Data Hunters compile and cultivate real world data sets for inclusion in the textbook and supplementary materials. If you’re interested in becoming a Data Hunter, please email me!\r\nRunner\r\nIn another life, I was a retail store manager at a local Fleet Feet. I spent years running 50+ miles per week and competing in races ranging from 5k’s to 100 miles (* only one of those). At one point I was even a member of (now defunct) PowerBar TeamElite. I still run but I’m not so fast anymore.\r\nTech Enthusiast\r\nI have always enjoyed technology. I like to tinker and to keep things running as long as I can. I just recently had to replace my laptop after 8 years and am typing this on a 10 year old desktop.\r\nCurrent Setup(s)\r\nLaptop\r\nDell G3 3590\r\nCPU: Intel Core i7-9750h\r\nMemory: 16 GB DDR4-2666\r\nStorage (boot): 500 GB Samsung 970 EVO m.2 nvme ssd\r\nStorage: 1 TB Seagate hdd\r\nWiFi: 802.11ax\r\nGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650\r\nDesktop\r\nDell XPS 8300\r\nCPU: Intel Core i7-2600\r\nCPU Cooler: Thermaltake Gravity i2\r\nMemory: 32 GB DDR3-1333\r\nStorage (boot): 240 GB Seagate BarraCuda ssd\r\nStorage: 500 GB WD Blue hdd\r\nWiFi: 802.11n\r\nGraphics: Nvidia GT 710\r\nPeripherals\r\nKeyboard: Keychron K4\r\nKeyboard: Keychron K6\r\nMouse: Corsair Harpoon\r\nMonitors: 2 x Dell 27\"\r\nNAS\r\nSynology DS 220j\r\n2 x 4 TB Seagate Ironwolf (raid 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nStat 231: Introductory Statistics\r\nThis course is intended for non-STEM majors.\r\nAn emphasis is placed on a broad understanding of topics in sampling methods, basic probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and linear regression.\r\nCourse Materials\r\nOur textbook is OpenIntro Statistics: 4th Ed..\r\nA graphing calculator will be useful for some of the computations we will do. Specifically instruction will be provided for the Ti-83/84 and Casio FX-750GII.\r\nWe will have a total of seven computer labs using R and RStudio. There will be dedicated class time to installing the software or setting up a cloud account. Those who feel comfortable doing so can download R and RStudio prior to the start of class.\r\nR Package\r\nAll materials needed for lab days can be found in the Stat231 R package. Students can install the package by running the code below in the console of RStudio (requires the devtools package). As with R and RStudio, there will be dedicated time in class for this activity.\r\n\r\ndevtools::install_github(“npaterno/stat231”, build_vignettes = TRUE)\r\n\r\nEach lesson can be found as a vignette in the help file. The corresponding assignments are available as RMarkdown templates.\r\nIf you happen to be an instructor who has stumbled across this page, you are free to use the package under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 License.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
