I started my career in January 2012. I’ve been a contingent faculty member the entire time. I currently teach as an adjunct associate professor at Pierce College and as a visiting instructor at Pacific Lutheran University.\r\nAside from teaching but still under the academic umbrella, I am a contributor with OpenIntro. Specifically I serve as the Data Management Lead. Fancy title that means I maintain an internal R package that serves as an intermediary between a team of volunteers, Data Hunters, and the {openintro} and {usdata} R packages. The Data Hunters compile and cultivate real world data sets for inclusion in the textbook and supplementary materials. If you’re interested in becoming a Data Hunter, please email me!\r\nRunner\r\nIn another life, I was a retail store manager at a local Fleet Feet. I spent years running 50+ miles per week and competing in races ranging from 5k’s to 100 miles (* only one of those). At one point I was even a member of (now defunct) PowerBar TeamElite. I still run but I’m not so fast anymore.\r\nTech Enthusiast\r\nI have always enjoyed technology. I like to tinker and to keep things running as long as I can. I just recently had to replace my laptop after 8 years and am typing this on a 10 year old desktop.\r\nCurrent Setup(s)\r\nLaptop\r\nDell G3 3590\r\nCPU: Intel Core i7-9750h\r\nMemory: 32 GB Crucial Ballistix DDR4-2666\r\nStorage (boot): 500 GB Samsung 970 EVO m.2 nvme ssd\r\nStorage: 1 TB Seagate hdd\r\nWiFi: 802.11ax\r\nGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650\r\nDesktop\r\nDell XPS 8300\r\nCPU: Intel Core i7-2600\r\nCPU Cooler: Thermaltake Gravity i2\r\nMemory: 32 GB DDR3-1333\r\nStorage (boot): 240 GB Seagate BarraCuda ssd\r\nStorage: 500 GB WD Blue hdd\r\nWiFi: 802.11n\r\nGraphics: Nvidia GT 710\r\nPeripherals\r\nKeyboard: Keychron K4\r\nKeyboard: Keychron K6\r\nMouse: Corsair Harpoon\r\nMonitors: 2 x Dell 27\"\r\nNAS\r\nSynology DS 220j\r\n2 x 4 TB Seagate Ironwolf (raid 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

More specifically, students will:\r\nGain insight into the statistical process as they execute a basic statistical study\r\nDevelop expertise interpreting and critiquing a statistical study\r\nUnderstand the basics and importance of statistical computing\r\nCourse Materials\r\nOur textbook is Introduction to Modern Statistics 1st Ed..\r\nWe will have a total of n computer labs using R and RStudio. There will be dedicated class time to installing the software or setting up a cloud account. Those who feel comfortable doing so can download R and RStudio prior to the start of class.\r\nR Package\r\nAll materials needed for lab days can be found in the stat242 R package (package under construction as of 7/14/21). Students can install the package by running the code below in the console of RStudio (requires the `remotes`` package). As with R and RStudio, there will be dedicated time in class for this activity.\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(“remotes”) remotes::install_github(“npaterno/stat242”, build_vignettes = TRUE)\r\n\r\nEach lesson can be found as a vignette in the help file or as a slidedeck.
