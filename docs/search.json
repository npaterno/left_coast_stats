I started my career in January 2012. I’ve been a contingent faculty member the entire time. I currently teach as an adjunct associate professor at Pierce College and as a resident instructor at Pacific Lutheran University.\nAside from teaching but still under the academic umbrella, I am a contributor with OpenIntro. Specifically I serve as the Data Management Lead. Fancy title that means I maintain an internal R package that serves as an intermediary between a team of volunteers, Data Hunters, and the {openintro} and {usdata} R packages. The Data Hunters compile and cultivate real world data sets for inclusion in the textbook and supplementary materials. If you’re interested in becoming a Data Hunter, please email me!\nRunner\nIn another life, I was a retail store manager at a local Fleet Feet. I spent years running 50+ miles per week and competing in races ranging from 5k’s to 100 miles (* only one of those). At one point I was even a member of (now defunct) PowerBar TeamElite. I still run but I’m not so fast anymore.\nTech Enthusiast\nI have always enjoyed technology. I like to tinker and to keep things running as long as possible and - when I can find the time and resrouces - to refurbish old computers for those in need.\nCurrent Setup(s)\nLaptop\nDell G3 3590\nCPU: Intel Core i7-9750h\nMemory: 32 GB Crucial Ballistix DDR4-2666\nStorage (boot): 500 GB Samsung 970 EVO m.2 nvme ssd\nStorage: 1 TB Seagate hdd\nWiFi: 802.11ax\nGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650\nDesktop\nApple Mac Mini\nCPU: Apple M1\nMemory: 16 GB\nStorage: 2 TB ssd\nWiFi: 802.11ax\nPeripherals\nKeyboard: Keychron K4\nKeyboard: Keychron K6\nMouse: Corsair Harpoon\nMonitors: 2 x Dell 27\"\nNAS\nSynology DS 220j\n2 x 4 TB Seagate Ironwolf (raid 1)\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nCourse Goals\n(Largely adapted from my colleague Dr. Justice)\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to navigate data-based claims that permeate our society and develop expertise to make informed data-based decisions. More specifically, students will:\nGain insight into the statistical process as they execute a basic statistical study\nDevelop expertise interpreting and critiquing a statistical study\nUnderstand the basics and importance of statistical computing\nCourse Materials\nOur textbook is Introduction to Modern Statistics 1st Ed..\nWe will have a total of n computer labs using R and RStudio. There will be dedicated class time to installing the software or setting up a cloud account. Those who feel comfortable doing so can download R and RStudio prior to the start of class.\nR Package\nAll materials needed for lab days can be found in the stat242 R package (package under construction as of 7/14/21). Students can install the package by running the code below in the console of RStudio (requires the `remotes`` package). As with R and RStudio, there will be dedicated time in class for this activity.\n\ninstall.packages(“remotes”)\n\n\nremotes::install_github(“npaterno/stat242”, build_vignettes = TRUE)\n\nEach lesson related to the statistical computing part of the course can be found as a vignette in the help file or as a slidedeck. The corresponding assignments are available as RMarkdown templates.\n\n\n\n",
