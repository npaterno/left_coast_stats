# Stat 231: Introductory Statistics

This course is intended for non-STEM majors.

An emphasis is placed on a broad understanding of topics in sampling methods, basic probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and linear regression.

# Course Materials

Our textbook is [OpenIntro Statistics: 4th Ed.](https://www.openintro.org/book/os).

A graphing calculator will be useful for some of the computations we will do. Specifically instruction will be provided for the Ti-83/84 and Casio FX-750GII. 

We will have a total of seven computer labs using R and RStudio. There will be dedicated class time to installing the software or setting up a cloud account. Those who feel comfortable doing so can download [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/download) prior to the start of class.

# R Package 
All materials needed for lab days can be found in the [Stat231](https://www.github.com/npaterno/Stat231) R package. Students can install the package by running the code below in the console of RStudio (requires the `remotes`` package). As with R and RStudio, there will be dedicated time in class for this activity. 

> install.packages("remotes")
> remotes::install_github("npaterno/stat231", build_vignettes = TRUE)

Each lesson can be found as a vignette in the help file. The corresponding assignments are available as RMarkdown templates.
