## Academic 
* BA, Mathematics, University of Montana, 2009
* MS, Mathematics, Portland State University, 2011
* [CV](https://npaterno.github.io/left_coast_stats/npaterno_cv.pdf)

By profession I'm an academic. I started my career in January 2012. I've been a contingent faculty member the entire time. I currently teach as an adjunct associate professor at [Pierce College](https://pierce.ctc.edu) and as a resident instructor at [Pacific Lutheran University](https://www.plu.edu). 

Aside from teaching but still under the academic umbrella, I am a Fellow with [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org). Specifically I help maintain a repository for R tutorials and I serve as the Data Management Lead. Fancy title that means I maintain an internal R package that serves as an intermediary between a team of volunteers, Data Hunters, and the \{openintro\} and \{usdata\} R packages. The Data Hunters compile and cultivate real world data sets for inclusion in the textbook and supplementary materials. If you're interested in becoming a Data Hunter, please [email me!](mailto:nick@openintro.org)

## Runner 
In another life, I was a retail store manager at a local Fleet Feet. I spent years running 50+ miles per week and competing in races ranging from 5k's to 100 miles (* only one of those). At one point I was even a member of (now defunct) PowerBar TeamElite. I still run but I'm not so fast anymore.

## Tech Enthusiast 
I have always enjoyed technology. I like to tinker and to keep things running as long as possible and - when I can find the time and resources - to refurbish old computers for those in need. 

I am currently (May 2023) have a few refurbish projects in the works. My personal hardware includes a Mac Mini (M1), MacBook Air (M1), Dell G3 and - for trouble shooting student issues - an old Chromebook. 

I am slowly getting into mechanical keyboards too. I haven't built one from scratch just yet. I currently have two Keychron keyboards; a K4 with Gateron brown switches and a K6 with Gateron blue switches.
